 *
 * This file is used to test your adder. 
 * Please DO NOT modify this file.
 * 
 * GUIDE:
 *   1. Create a RTL project in Vivado
 *   2. Put `adder.v' OR `adder2.v' into `Sources', DO NOT add both of them at the same time.
 *   3. Put this file into `Simulation Sources'
 *   4. Run Behavioral Simulation
 *   5. Make sure to run at least 100 steps during the simulation (usually 100ns)
 *   6. You can see the results in `Tcl console'
 *
